# Interactive-Crossword-Puzzle-tutorial # :metal:



The Interactive Crossword Puzzle Game is a web-based game that challenges players to complete a randomly generated crossword puzzle within a set amount of time. The game is built using React and relies on an external API to provide the crossword puzzle data.

## List of Task ##


Here's how you could approach the task:

 1. Research and choose a suitable external API that provides crossword puzzle data. One such API is the Crossword Nexus API.
 2. Set up a new React project and create a new component called CrosswordGame.
 3. Inside the CrosswordGame component, create a new state variable to keep track of the current crossword puzzle data. The initial state can be an empty object.
 4. Use the external API to fetch a random crossword puzzle and update the state with the puzzle data.
 5. Render the crossword puzzle in the component using HTML and CSS.
 6. Create a form that allows users to input their guesses for the crossword puzzle clues.
 7. Create an event handler function that is triggered when the form is submitted. The function should check the user's answer against the correct answer and update the state with the new puzzle data, including the user's progress.
 8. Display the user's progress on the crossword puzzle by highlighting the correct letters in the puzzle grid.
 9. Add a timer to the game that limits the user's time to complete the puzzle.
 10. When the user successfully completes the puzzle, display a message congratulating them and offering the option to play again.
